# Design Patterns in C# #

### Overview ###

This is a simple console application written in C# that demonstrates the implementation of various design patterns. The purpose of this project is to provide a practical understanding of commonly used design patterns in software development.

### Design Patterns Implemented ###

The project includes implementations of the following design patterns:

**Factory Pattern:** Encapsulates object creation to promote loose coupling.

**Observer Pattern:** Implements a subscription model to notify multiple objects of state changes.

**Repository Pattern:** Provides an abstraction layer over data storage and retrieval.

**Facade Pattern:** Simplifies complex subsystems by providing a unified interface.
